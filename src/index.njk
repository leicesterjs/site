<p>We have big news! We're forming a collaboration between NottsJS and LeicesterJS - a new meetup group called <a href="https://midlandsjs.org/">MidlandsJS</a>. We have combined the existing organisation teams that center around David Wood, Katie Walker, Jerome Twell and Josh Ghent. With more resources we are delivering an even better meetup - especially for the times that we are still remote.</p>

<p>We will be closing this meetup group at the end of April. So, please join our new group here:</p>

<p>We're really grateful for everyones support and guidance when building LeicesterJS. This meetup is what it is because of the people. It's hard to believe our first meetup was back in September 2018! We hope that you'll continue to support and attend our events going forward.</p>
